For blanking the storage endpoints, please follow these steps:

0) Stop Atlas.

1) Open Solr Web UI, go to "Core Admin" menu, and select "edge_index_shard1_replica1", then click "Unload". Login to a node which has hbase client, and start "hbase shell".

2) Login to a node which has hbase client, and start "hbase shell", then run the following commands:
    disable 'atlas_titan'
    disable 'ATLAS_ENTITY_AUDIT_EVENTS'
    drop 'atlas_titan'
    drop 'ATLAS_ENTITY_AUDIT_EVENTS'

    # Example output:
    # hbase(main):005:0* disable 'atlas_titan'
    # 0 row(s) in 2.5150 seconds
    #
    # hbase(main):006:0>
    # hbase(main):007:0* disable 'ATLAS_ENTITY_AUDIT_EVENTS'
    # 0 row(s) in 2.2400 seconds
    #
    # hbase(main):008:0>
    # hbase(main):009:0* drop 'atlas_titan'
    # 0 row(s) in 1.2620 seconds
    #
    # hbase(main):010:0>
    # hbase(main):011:0* drop 'ATLAS_ENTITY_AUDIT_EVENTS'2

3) Start Atlas UI, wait for it to finish starting up and try logging into it. If everything goes fine, log out and stop the service once again.

4) Run the import-hive.sh script as shown in this article: https://community.hortonworks.com/articles/61274/import-hive-metadata-into-atlas.html
    Log into node with Atlas server.
    Switch to hive user: su - hive
    source /etc/hadoop/conf/hadoop-env.sh
    export ATLASCPPATH=$ATLASCPPATH:/usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/lib/hbase-common.jar
    /usr/hdp/current/atlas-client/hook-bin/import-hive.sh
